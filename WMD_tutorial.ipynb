For example, in a blog post [OpenTable](http://tech.opentable.com/2015/08/11/navigating-themes-in-restaurant-reviews-with-word-movers-distance/) use WMD on restaurant reviews. Using this approach, they are able to mine different aspects of the reviews. In **part 2** of this tutorial, we show how you can use Gensim's `WmdSimilarity` to do something similar to what OpenTable did. In **part 1** shows how you can compute the WMD distance between two documents using `wmdistance`. Part 1 is optional if you want use `WmdSimilarity`, but is also useful in it's own merit.\n","\n","First, however, we go through the basics of what WMD is.\n","\n","## Word Mover's Distance basics\n","\n","WMD is a method that allows us to assess the \"distance\" between two documents in a meaningful way, even when they have no words in common. It uses [word2vec](http://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/) [4] vector embeddings of words. It been shown to outperform many of the state-of-the-art methods in *k*-nearest neighbors classification [3].\n","\n","WMD is illustrated below for two very similar sentences (illustration taken from [Vlad Niculae's blog](http://vene.ro/blog/word-movers-distance-in-python.html)). The sentences have no words in common, but by matching the relevant words, WMD is able to accurately measure the (dis)similarity between the two sentences. The method also uses the bag-of-words representation of the documents (simply put, the word's frequencies in the documents), noted as $d$ in the figure below. The intuition behind the method is that we find the minimum \"traveling distance\" between documents, in other words the most efficient way to \"move\" the distribution of document 1 to the distribution of document 2.\n","\n","<img src='https://vene.ro/images/wmd-obama.png' height='600' width='600'>\n","\n","\n","This method was introduced in the article \"From Word Embeddings To Document Distances\" by Matt Kusner et al. ([link to PDF](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/kusnerb15.pdf)). It is inspired by the \"Earth Mover's Distance\", and employs a solver of the \"transportation problem\".\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Gensim's WMD functionality, which consists of the `wmdistance` method for distance computation, and the `WmdSimilarity` class for corpus based similarity queries.\n","\n","> **Note**:\n",">\n","> If you use this software, please consider citing [1], [2] and [3].\n",">\n","\n","## Running this notebook\n","\n","You can download this [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), and run it on your own computer, provided you have installed Gensim, PyEMD, NLTK, and downloaded the necessary data.\n","\n","The notebook was run on an Ubuntu machine with an Intel core i7-4770 CPU 3.40GHz (8 cores) and 32 GB memory. Running the entire notebook on this machine takes about 3 minutes.\n","\n","## Part 1: Computing the Word Mover's Distance\n","\n","To use WMD, we need some word embeddings first of all. You could train a word2vec (see tutorial [here](http://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/)) model on some corpus, but we will start by downloading some pre-trained word2vec embeddings. Download the GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz embeddings [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) (warning: 1.5 GB, file is not needed for part 2).
